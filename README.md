# Introduction 
Hello world :), Am a full stack trainee developer. Currently enrolled in a JS software development bootcamp, hence I am looking forward to sharpen my skills in web development.

### Reading Interpretation
The reading was about the developer mindest. People usually tend to overlook mindset and realise the it's importance lately in thier careers. Therefore building a a great mindset since day 1 is a very important step up in your career. Below you'll find my interpretation of the article listed as points: 

1. Outline the purpose of the software as it's always easy to be misguided hence leading to the fatal mistake of having an over-complicated software that isn't reuseable nor maintainble and the user doesn't actually benefit from it. 

2. There is always infinate ways to solve a problem so you'll always have to choose one but the choice shouldn't be an arbitrary one you sould always consider the equation D=V/E. 

3. There is nothing hard. All you need to do is to outline the issue and break it down to smaller pieces, this will help you to have a better understanding  of the problem and if things are still not clear try explaining the issues to others this will help you a lot.

4. Be as simple as you can. Your mind can easily over complicate the problem which leads: 
    1. Writing code that isnâ€™t needed. 
    2. Missing deadlines 
    3. increasing complexity by adding unnecessary codes
You should always start with the simplest version in mind and start improving it util you reach the good level which is fine. 

5. Do not predict the future and act based on it therefoe you might end up losing the present as well. Don't predict or assume something and act based on them stay focused on what in hand right now and if these feature or issues arise in the future you can always add them later. 

6. You should always be open to changes as they are the way to improve. 

7. Coding is all about automation, try avoiding repetitive tasks. 

8. Commenting is not about the HOW it's done it's about WHY the code it self should be self explanatory.

9. You shouldn't follow the latest technologies blindely there must always be a why for your usage and you should always reduce you dependency on them. 

10. Self development should be a lifestyle, be open to all new technolgies and don't stop at one point there is always more.
