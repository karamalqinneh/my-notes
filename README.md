# Introduction 
Hello world :), Am a full stack trainee developer. Currently enrolled in a JS software development bootcamp, hence I am looking forward to sharpen my skills in web development.

## Reading Interpretation
The reading was about the developer mindest. People usually tend to overlook mindset and realise the it's importance lately in thier careers. Therefore building a a great mindset since day 1 is a very important step up in your career. Below you'll find my interpretation of the article listed as points: 

1. Outline the purpose of the software as it's always easy to be misguided hence leading to the fatal mistake of having an over-complicated software that isn't reuseable nor maintainble and the user doesn't actually benefit from it. 

2. There is always infinate ways to solve a problem so you'll always have to choose one but the choice shouldn't be an arbitrary one you sould always consider the equation D=V/E. 

3. There is nothing hard. All you need to do is to outline the issue and break it down to smaller pieces, this will help you to have a better understanding  of the problem and if things are still not clear try explaining the issues to others this will help you a lot.
